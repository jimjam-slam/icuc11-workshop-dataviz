# ICUC11 Data Vis Workshop

## Getting started

[Launch the workshop Codespace](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=main&repo=674194662&machine=basicLinux32gb)

The above link will create a new Codespace, even if you already have one running.

To recover a space that you previously created (eg. if you accidentally closed your browser), go to <https://github.com/codespaces> and choose your space from the list (it'll have a randomly assigned name).
