Otherwise, you can run code interactively by clicking "Run Cell" at the top of each piece of code to run it in an R terminal.

Before we do anything, let's load the packages we'll need for this lesson:

```{r}
#| label: setup

library(tidyverse)
```

Let's try a basic plot on the price of diamonds. We'll see it as `plot1.png`:

```{r}
#| label: plot1

plot1 <- ggplot(diamonds) +
  aes(carat, price, colour = clarity) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_minimal(base_family = "Handjet") +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "white"))

# view the plot interactively
plot1

# save the plot to disk
ggsave("plot1.png", plot1)
```

That's all for now!
