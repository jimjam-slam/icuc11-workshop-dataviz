# Welcome to the workshop!

You've opened the workshop cloud environment!

For this demo, let's start off looking at [`index.qmd`](/index.qmd). It has some R code in it that shows off what we can do.

There are two ways to run the code in `index.qmd`:

1. You can run pieces of code, called _cells_, by clicking "Run Code" above each cell. Or,
2. You can render the whole document by clicking "Render" at the top right of the editor.
